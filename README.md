# Console Shape Application Project
This C++ project is designed to get geometrical properties of shapes. The project follows a modular structure with separate header (.h) and implementation (.cpp) files for each class.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhicctech1003/SHAPES.git
    ```

2. **Build the Project:**

    Open the project in your preferred C++ IDE or build using the command line.

3. **Run the Application:**

    Execute the built binary to run the application.

## Folder Structure
The project is organized into the following folders:

- **include**: Contains header files for each geometric shape class.
 
- **src**: Contains implementation files corresponding to each header file.
 
- **main.cpp**: Main source file where the program execution starts.

## 1. Line
 
- Header: include/Line.h
 
- Implementation: src/Line.cpp
 
## 2. Triangle
 
- Header: include/Triangle.h
 
- Implementation: src/Triangle.cpp
 
## 3. Square
 
- Header: include/Square.h
 
- Implementation: src/Square.cpp

## 4. Rectangle
 
- Header: include/Rectangle.h
 
- Implementation: src/Rectangle.cpp
 
## 5. Circle
 
- Header: include/Circle.h
 
- Implementation: src/Circle.cpp
 
## 6. Ellipse
 
- Header: include/Ellipse.h
 
- Implementation: src/Ellipse.cpp
